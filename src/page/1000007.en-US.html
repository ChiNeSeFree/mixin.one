    <p>What drives us to build Mixin is our mission to have daily private and secure end-to-end encrypted communications, without the need to set up complicated secret keys.</p>
    <p>Mixin's end-to-end encryption built on Signal protocol ensures only you and the people you're communicating with can read what is sent, and nobody in between, not even Mixin nodes.</p>
    <p>At times, you may see "Waiting for the sender to get online and establish an encrypted session" in place of what you were sent from a contact. This can typically occur if you or the people you're chatting with recently reinstalled Mixin or did a fresh log in.</p>
    <p>To speed up this process, notify the people you're messaging to open Mixin on their phone.</p>
    <p>End-to-end encryption is always activated, there is no way to turn off end-to-end encryption.</p>

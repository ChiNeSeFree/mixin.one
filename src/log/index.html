      <h2>Airdrop Policy</h2>
      <p class="time">April 11, 2018</p>
      <p>Mixin acts like the lighting network for Bitcoin when serves as a wallet for other blockchain assets, so it's impossible to handle Airdrops based on address balance.</p>
      <p>Mixin address can actually receive those kind of Airdrops, but the amount may be incorrect in most time, it may be much larger or smaller.</p>
      <p>If you take those Airdrops seriously, please transfer your related assets to supported wallets before the corresponding events.</p>

      <h2>High Security Enforced Updates</h2>
      <p class="time">April 9, 2018</p>
      <p>Mixin has evolved a lot in security management during recent updates and will keep doing so.</p>
      <p>There are always multiple Mixin versions supported at the same time, and to enforce security we have stopped supporting old versions prioror to 0.2.0 for both Android and iOS.</p>
      <p>If you found any sign in or PIN incorrect issues, please update your Mixin app to latest version at first.</p>

      <h2>Mixin Node Incentive Updates</h2>
      <p class="time">April 8, 2018</p>
      <p>Mixin network is not only a fast and free distributed ledger, it also manages the most convenient and fast growing lighting network for other blockchains.</p>
      <p>Though the ledger is free at most time, Mixin is designed to incentive the nodes in some creative ways. One of them is the miner fee for other blockchain transactions.</p>
      <p>All blockchains assets can be transfered free within Mixin distributed ledger network, but fee will be charged when transfered out of Mixin network, and the fee is usally higher than that charged by the miner.</p>
      <p>The differences between the fee charged by Mixin network and the miner will be shared among Mixin nodes and XIN holders as incentive.</p>
